## 1. Overview
Network Performance Analyser is a lightweight, real-time network monitoring application designed to provide clear insights into network usage.  
It captures live network traffic and presents performance metrics through an interactive graphical dashboard.

The tool focuses on **clarity, performance, and extensibility**, making it suitable for both quick diagnostics and deeper analysis.

## 2. Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide high-level network insights such as bandwidth usage, traffic distribution, and communication patterns for users to leanr more about their network health and potential bottlenecks.

The project also serves as a practical investigation into:
- Network monitoring techniques
- Flow-based traffic analysis
- Real-time visualization of network metrics

** The purpose is not to replace or reproduce deep analysis tools like Wireshark, for deeper analysis, tools like Wireshark should be used as this provides top level information **

## 3. Goals

### Primary Goals
- Monitor network traffic in real time
- Display key performance metrics (bandwidth, jitter, latency, packets per second, total data)
- Identify top hosts and network flows
- Provide a clean, responsive graphical interface

### Secondary Goals
- Modular and extensible architecture
- Minimal performance overhead
- Support for multiple os
